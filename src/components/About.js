				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>
					I'm a full-stack web developer and former classroom educator. I joined
					the field of software development because I enjoy using logical
					reasoning and problem-solving to bring lines of code to life.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					I'm a fast learner and doer, adept at building on my prior knowledge
					and finding resources to bridge gaps in my understanding. The
					communication and collaboration skills I've developed over my career
					as an educator and my experience working with diverse groups of people
					are strengths that I bring to all of my pursuits.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					I'm always learning and growing, and I'm excited to apply all that
					I've learned toward finding solutions for real-world problems.
				</p>

				<h2>Outside of Coding</h2>
				<p>
					My interests in making things extend past the computer screen; I send
					hand-drawn postcards when I travel, and I make hand-bound journals.
					I'm currently working on a book about my experiences in education.
